#### Grazing Areas Without River Access in California

##### Introduction

This report presents a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of grazing areas in California that lack direct access to rivers, aiming to support land management and conservation efforts by identifying and characterizing these areas. Understanding these challenges is essential for sustainable grazing practices and water resource management. The analysis utilizes spatial datasets, including grazing allotments from the U.S. Forest Service ([S_USA.Allotment.zip](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/shp/S_USA.Allotment.zip)), major rivers and creeks from the California Natural Resources Agency ([NHD Major Rivers and Creeks](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/511528b2-f7d3-4d86-8902-cc9befeeeed5/resource/7d1e7e44-81b1-43fe-95f6-1862eea6ac24/download/nhd_major_rivers_and_creeks.zip)), and California geographic boundaries from California Open Data ([CA Geographic Boundaries](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-geographic-boundaries)). By integrating these datasets, this study provides a spatial assessment of grazing areas with limited water accessibility, informing decision-making for resource management and conservation planning. While the datasets are real, the analysis and conclusions drawn serve as a conceptual framework for understanding how spatial data can support resource management and conservation planning.

##### Objectives

The study aims to:

-   Identify grazing areas in California without direct river access.
-   Quantify and rank these areas by size.
-   Visualize their distribution across the state.
-   Provide data-driven insights to inform land management and conservation strategies.

##### Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging ArcPy, GeoPandas, and Matplotlib. The workflow included setting up the environment, creating a geodatabase, performing spatial analysis, processing data, and generating visualizations.

##### Code Implementation

To begin, the analysis required several key libraries.

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
import arcpy
import os
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define paths
data_dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())
grazing_area_shapefile_path = os.path.join(data_dir_path, "Grazing_Analysis")
rivers_shapefile_path = os.path.join(data_dir_path, "Grazing_Analysis")
output_gdb = os.path.join(data_dir_path, "California.gdb")
output_directory = os.path.join(data_dir_path, "Output")

# Set ArcPy environment to allow overwriting
arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True
```
:::

Next, a geodatabase was created to store the results of the analysis

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
try:
    # Check if geodatabase exists and delete if it does
    if arcpy.Exists(output_gdb):
        arcpy.Delete_management(output_gdb)

    # Create a new geodatabase
    arcpy.CreateFileGDB_management(data_dir_path, "California.gdb")
except arcpy.ExecuteError:
    print(f"ArcPy error: {arcpy.GetMessages(2)}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"General error: {e}")
```
:::

With the geodatabase prepared, the next step was to populate it with the input data.

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
# Copy shapefiles to geodatabase
shapefile_paths = [grazing_area_shapefile_path, rivers_shapefile_path]
for shapefile_dir in shapefile_paths:
    arcpy.env.workspace = shapefile_dir
    fc_list = arcpy.ListFeatureClasses()
    for shapefile in fc_list:
        arcpy.FeatureClassToGeodatabase_conversion(shapefile, output_gdb)
```
:::

To perform the spatial analysis, feature layers were created, and grazing areas without river access were selected.

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
# Create feature layers
arcpy.MakeFeatureLayer_management("California_Allotments", "Allotment_area_layer")
arcpy.MakeFeatureLayer_management("California_Rivers", "Rivers_layer")

# Select grazing areas without river access
arcpy.management.SelectLayerByLocation("Allotment_area_layer", "INTERSECT", "Rivers_layer", invert_spatial_relationship=True)
grazing_area_without_rivers = "grazing_area_without_rivers"
arcpy.CopyFeatures_management("Allotment_area_layer", grazing_area_without_rivers)
```
:::

To analyze the selected areas, their names and sizes were extracted and then sorted

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
# Retrieve grazing area names and sizes
grazing_area_with_area = []
with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(grazing_area_without_rivers, ["ALLOTMENT_", "Shape_Area"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        grazing_area_with_area.append((row[0], row[1]))

# Sort grazing areas by size
sorted_grazing_area = sorted(grazing_area_with_area, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
:::

Finally, to visualize the results, a bar chart of the top 10 largest grazing areas without river access was generated.

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
# Plot top 10 grazing areas
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
top_10_names = [area[0] for area in sorted_grazing_area[:10]]
top_10_areas = [area[1] for area in sorted_grazing_area[:10]]
bars = plt.bar(top_10_names, top_10_areas)
plt.title("Top 10 Grazing Areas Without River Access", fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel("Grazing Area Name", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Area", fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')

for bar in bars:
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., bar.get_height(), f'{bar.get_height():.2f}', ha='center', va='bottom')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(os.path.join(data_dir_path, "top_10_grazing_areas_plot.png"))
```
:::

A spatial distribution map of the to 10 largest grazing areas across carlifonia without river access was generated

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
# Reproject to UTM Zone 10N
utm_spatial_ref = arcpy.SpatialReference(32610)
output_utm_fc = os.path.join(output_directory, "grazing_area_without_rivers_UTM.shp")
arcpy.Project_management(grazing_area_without_rivers, output_utm_fc, utm_spatial_ref)

gdf = gpd.read_file(output_utm_fc)
california_boundary_shapefile = os.path.join(data_dir_path, "CA_State.shp")
california_gdf = gpd.read_file(california_boundary_shapefile)
california_gdf = california_gdf.to_crs(utm_spatial_ref.exportToString())

gdf['Area'] = gdf.geometry.area
sorted_gdf = gdf.sort_values('Area', ascending=False)
top_10_gdf = sorted_gdf.head(10)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(20, 15))
top_10_gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', edgecolor='black')
california_gdf.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color="red", linewidth=1)
label_offset = 1000
for idx, row in top_10_gdf.iterrows():
    centroid = row.geometry.centroid
    ax.text(centroid.x + label_offset, centroid.y + label_offset, row['ALLOTMENT_'], fontsize=5, color='black', ha='center', bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.7, edgecolor='none', boxstyle="round,pad=0.3"))
ax.set_title("Top 10 Grazing Areas Without River Access in California", fontsize=12)
ax.set_xlabel("Easting (meters)", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Northing (meters)", fontsize=12)
plt.show()
plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_directory, "top_10_grazing_areas_map.png"), dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

The GIS analysis revealed that 283 grazing areas in California lack direct access to rivers, with the Mono Sand Flat C & H being the largest at approximately 70443 acres. These areas, which collectively cover 2525779 acres, are mainly concentrated in the Northern and Eastern parts of the state. These grazing areas range in size from 5 to 70443 square kilometers, the top 10 largest account for about 60% of the total affected grazing land. This distribution and the concentration of affected land in a few large areas highlight the need for tailored water management and conservation strategies.

##### Discussion

The analysis highlights several critical factors that influence sustainable land management and conservation efforts. These findings provide essential insights into spatial distribution, water resource management, ecological implications, and broader policy considerations.

Spatial Distribution and Access Challenges: The identification of 283 grazing areas without river access underscores a significant challenge in rangeland management. These areas are largely concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of California, suggesting regional disparities in water availability. Limited access to natural water sources may increase reliance on artificial water infrastructure, which could pose economic and logistical challenges for ranchers and land managers.

Water Resource Management: The absence of direct river access necessitates alternative water sources, such as groundwater wells, reservoirs, and constructed water points. Given California's strict water regulations and the ongoing implementation of Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs), managing water use efficiently in these grazing areas is crucial. Over-extraction of groundwater could lead to long-term environmental degradation, making strategic water management a priority for sustaining livestock and rangeland health.

Ecological Implications: Grazing areas without river access may have different vegetation dynamics and soil characteristics compared to riparian zones. The lack of a steady water supply could lead to lower biomass production, affecting forage availability for livestock. Additionally, these areas might experience increased soil erosion and habitat fragmentation, impacting local biodiversity. Effective grazing strategies, such as rotational grazing, could mitigate these risks and maintain ecological balance.

Land Use and Conservation Considerations: Understanding the spatial distribution of these grazing areas informs land use planning and conservation efforts. Restricted water access may influence grazing intensity, requiring adaptive management approaches. Conservation programs could prioritize these areas for habitat restoration projects, water conservation incentives, and sustainable grazing initiatives to prevent land degradation.

Climate Change Considerations: Climate change poses an additional threat to grazing areas with limited water access. Increasing temperatures and prolonged droughts could further exacerbate water scarcity, making these lands even more vulnerable. Adaptive strategies, such as drought-resilient grazing systems and water-efficient technologies, are essential for ensuring long-term sustainability.

Policy Implications: The findings highlight the need for policy interventions to support ranchers managing grazing lands without river access. Policies could focus on financial assistance for water infrastructure development, incentives for sustainable grazing practices, and regulatory adjustments to facilitate efficient water use. Collaboration between government agencies, conservation organizations, and landowners will be key to developing comprehensive solutions.

##### Recommendations

Based on the analysis and discussion, the following recommendations can be made:

1.  Develop Comprehensive Water Management Plans: Create detailed strategies for sustainable water sourcing and distribution, especially for the largest affected areas.

2.  Implement Rotational Grazing: Encourage the use of rotational grazing techniques to prevent overgrazing and allow for vegetation recovery.

3.  Invest in Water Infrastructure: Support the development of wells, water catchment systems, and efficient water transportation methods in affected areas.

4.  Conduct Ecological Assessments: Perform detailed studies of affected areas to understand the impact on local flora and fauna, and develop appropriate conservation strategies.

5.  Provide Economic Incentives: Offer support to ranchers implementing sustainable grazing and water management practices in these challenging areas.

6.  Research Alternative Water Sources: Invest in innovative water sourcing techniques suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.

7.  Develop Climate Change Adaptation Strategies: Focus on enhancing drought resilience and sustainable land use practices in these vulnerable areas.

8.  Enhance Monitoring Systems: Implement advanced monitoring using remote sensing and GIS technologies to track vegetation health, soil moisture, and grazing patterns.

9.  Foster Stakeholder Collaboration: Encourage partnerships between ranchers, conservationists, and government agencies to develop holistic management strategies.

10. Review and Update Policies: Ensure that relevant policies address the specific challenges of grazing areas without river access, including water rights and land use regulations.
