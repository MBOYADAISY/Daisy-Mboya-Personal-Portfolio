About me

I am currently diving deep into the field of Geomatics for Environmental Managemnt through my studies at UBC, after earning my undergraduate degree in Geospatial Engineering at the University of Nairobi. What excites me most about geospatial technologies is their power to unlock meaningful insights from data and apply them to real-world challenges, from urban development to environmental sustainability.

Throughout my journey, I've had the chance to work with a wide array of geospatial tools and data—from GIS software like ArcGIS and QGIS, to remote sensing and spatial analysis in R and Python. My experience spans various projects, including land use planning and infrastructure management, where I’ve helped teams integrate complex datasets and use data-driven solutions to inform project decisions.

What keeps me inspired is the opportunity to bring data to life. I’ve developed a strong skillset in data management, automation with Python, and creating visualizations that make complex information easier to understand for stakeholders. Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to apply these tools in practical, impactful ways.

I invite you to explore the projects and research I’ve worked on, where I share the tools, methodologies, and insights I’ve gained. My aim is to continue learning and applying my knowledge to contribute to more sustainable development and effective planning in both urban and environmental contexts.
