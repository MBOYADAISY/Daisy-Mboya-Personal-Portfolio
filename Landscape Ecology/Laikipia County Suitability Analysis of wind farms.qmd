##### Location of Suitable sites for Wind Farms in Laikipia County,Kenya

###### Abstract

In Kenya, a wide gap exists between wind resource and actual energy production, and it is imperative to expand the wind energy development, being cleaner and climate-friendly. Because of the formidable costs associated with wind energy development, the locations for new wind turbines need to be carefully selected to provide the greatest benefit for a given investment. In this study, the adopted siting criteria were identified based on expert opinion and literature review, a relevant GIS database was created and a GIS-based multi-criteria approach developed to identify the areas that are best suited for wind energy development in Laikipia County, Kenya. The adopted multi-criteria approach utilizes AHP to determine weights of the siting criteria (factors and constraints) and develops a composite suitability map from single-factor maps representing these criteria.

The developed decision support tool is capable of identifying priority areas for wind farm development with the results of this work indicating approximately 3.24% of the total study area being of high suitability, 31.07% of medium suitability and 3.04% of low suitability. A follow up study can be conducted to find out the community response to any potential wind installation on their land, as the approach selected could help support sustainable spatial policy development on all levels of public administration related to renewable resources use.

###### Methodology

The study utilized a multi-criteria decision-making process to evaluate suitable wind farm locations in Laikipia County, considering both technical feasibility and socio-environmental factors. Constraints, such as wind speed, slope, and proximity to built-up areas, roads, protected zones, water bodies, and power lines, were factored in to exclude unfeasible areas. Decision factors, such as wind speed, land cover, and proximity to infrastructure, were used to assess the suitability of potential sites. Data for these factors was gathered from various sources, including the Global Wind Atlas, Sentinel-2A satellite observations, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data.

AHP was employed to weigh the importance of each criterion through pairwise comparisons between two experts in renewable energy. The criteria were assigned weights based on their relative importance, and a consistency ratio was calculated to ensure the reliability of the findings. The final output was a weighted matrix that represented the relative significance of each factor in determining the optimal locations for wind farms.

###### Key Findings

The GIS-based analysis revealed the most suitable sites for wind farm development, highlighting key factors such as wind speed, distance to infrastructure, and land cover. Wind speed was the most influential factor (50.42%), followed by distance from built-up areas (20.41%) and land cover (11.68%). Based on these weighted criteria, a suitability map was developed, categorizing areas into high, medium, and low suitability zones. Areas with protected zones or built-up regions were identified as unsuitable for development. The final suitability map emphasized the central region of Laikipia, where conditions were most favorable for wind energy production due to optimal wind speeds, fewer protected areas, and better infrastructure access.

###### Conclusion

The study identified that approximately 37.2% of Laikipia County is suitable for wind energy projects, with protected areas covering the majority of exclusion zones (45.96%). Several constraints, including proximity to urban areas, roads, and protected zones, limit development in certain parts of the county. Notably, the central region, particularly around the Sosian area in Laikipia North, stands out as the most promising for wind energy development, aligning with findings from the Energy Regulatory Commission. This area benefits from higher wind potential, favorable land cover, and fewer restrictions from protected zones and built-up areas.

The analysis also revealed that high-suitability areas are primarily located on cropland, while medium-suitability zones tend to be near forest reserves and natural habitats. These areas, while still viable, have smaller extents due to their proximity to environmental constraints. This classification of areas into high, medium, and low suitability zones underscores the varying degrees of feasibility for wind farm development across Laikipia County, offering valuable insights for future wind energy initiatives and policy decisions.
